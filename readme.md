## implement Object-Oriented by Clang

### encapsulation

We can use header file to implement encapsulation mechanism, the client program can use declaration in the header file only and have absolutely no knowledge of the implementation.

### inheritance

We can use type cast to convert one pointer of user defiend struct to another, so that we can access the member of the another user defined struct.

### polymorphism

We can use function pointer variable to perform different behavior.
